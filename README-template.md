## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- GIT

### What I learned

I learned to build a QR code component from scratch and to get it looking as close to the design provided as possible, using: HTML5 to structure the project, CSS3 to stilize it with custom properties and flexbox to set the layout. I also implemented a mobile-first workflow and I used SASS to compile my .css file. Finally I used GIT to publish the project on my [Github repository](https://github.com/EstanisEVL).

### Continued development

I want to focus on my code eficiency, keeping it as clean and short as possible without losing any of its funcionalities. I also want to keep improving my skills with SASS to organize my projects and make them easy to pick up to anyone who wants to work on them.
